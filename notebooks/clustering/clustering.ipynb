    "We used the KMeans implementation from `sklearn.cluster` with `n_init=50` and `max_iter=500` to ensure robust clustering results and sufficient convergence. The algorithm was applied to L2-normed spectra extracted from `final_map`, as well as to `denoised_final_map` after applying the same L2 normalization. This normalization step ensures that each spectrum has unit length, making the clustering process focus on the shape of the spectra rather than their absolute intensities. Using consistent normalization across both datasets allows for a fair comparison of clustering results before and after denoising."
